# DSA-HW01---Sparse-Matrix
Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment: Sparse Matrix Operations

Task Description This assignment involves reading sparse matrices from input files, performing operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on them via an interactive menu, and generating an output file containing the result of the selected operation.

Instructions Directory Structure Organize your project files into the following structure:

DSA-HW01---Sparse-Matrix/ └── matrix ├── code │ └── src │ └── main.py ├── sample_inputs │ ├── matrix1.txt │ └── matrix2.txt └── sample_results └── (output files will be generated here)

Steps to Execute Directory Setup: Ensure the directory structure is as shown above.

Input Files: Place your input files (e.g., matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt) in the sample_inputs directory. Note: Each input file should have the first two lines indicating the matrix dimensions (e.g., rows=3 and cols=4), followed by lines in the format (row, col, value) for nonzero elements.

Output Files: The result of any matrix operation will be saved in the sample_results directory with a name indicating the operation performed (e.g., addition_result.txt).

Interactive Operations: When the script runs, it will present an interactive menu. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation:

Addition Subtraction Multiplication Exit Running the Script Open Terminal: Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the Code Directory: Change your working directory to the location of main.py: cd /DSA-HW01---Sparse-Matrix/matrix/code/src Execute the Script: Run the script using Python: python main.py Follow Prompts: Use the interactive menu to choose your desired matrix operation. The results will be displayed on-screen and saved to the appropriate output file in the sample_results directory.
